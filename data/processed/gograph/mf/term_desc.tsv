Term	Index	Name
GO:0003674	0	A molecular process that can be carried out by the action of a single macromolecular machine, usually via direct physical interactions with other molecular entities. Function in this sense denotes an action, or activity, that a gene product (or a complex) performs. These actions are described from two distinct but related perspectives: (1) biochemical activity, and (2) role as a component in a larger system/process.
GO:0140522	1	The activity of joining two lipid bilayers to form a single membrane.
GO:0140110	2	A molecular function that controls the rate, timing and/or magnitude of gene transcription. The function of transcriptional regulators is to modulate gene expression at the transcription step so that they are expressed in the right cell at the right time and in the right amount throughout the life of the cell and the organism. Genes are transcriptional units, and include bacterial operons.
GO:0060090	3	The binding activity of a molecule that brings together two or more molecules through a selective, non-covalent, often stoichiometric interaction, permitting those molecules to function in a coordinated way.
GO:0140223	4	A molecular function required for core promoter activity that mediates the assembly of the RNA polymerase holoenzyme at promoter DNA to form the pre-initiation complex (PIC). General transcription factors (GTFs) bind to and open promoter DNA, initiate RNA synthesis and stimulate the escape of the polymerase from the promoter. Not all subunits of the general transcription factor are necessarily present at all promoters to initiate transcription. GTFs act at each promoter, although the exact subunit composition at individual promoters may vary.
GO:0140104	5	Directly binding to a specific ion or molecule and delivering it either to an acceptor molecule or to a specific location.

GO:0003824	8	Catalysis of a biochemical reaction at physiological temperatures. In biologically catalyzed reactions, the reactants are known as substrates, and the catalysts are naturally occurring macromolecular substances known as enzymes. Enzymes possess specific binding sites for substrates, and are usually composed wholly or largely of protein, but RNA that has catalytic activity (ribozyme) is often also regarded as enzymatic.
GO:0098772	9	A molecular function regulator regulates the activity of its target via non-covalent binding that does not result in covalent modification to the target. Examples of molecular function regulators include regulatory subunits of multimeric enzymes and channels. Mechanisms of regulation include allosteric changes in the target and competitive inhibition.

GO:0003712	33	A transcription regulator activity that modulates the transcription of specific gene sets via binding to a DNA-bound DNA-binding transcription factor, either on its own or as part of a complex. Coregulators often act by altering chromatin structure and modifications. For example, one class of transcription coregulators modifies chromatin structure through covalent modification of histones. A second class remodels the conformation of chromatin in an ATP-dependent fashion. A third class modulates interactions of DNA-bound DNA-binding transcription factors with other transcription coregulators.
GO:0001070	34	A transcription regulator activity that modulates the transcription of specific gene sets via selective and non-covalent binding to a specific RNA sequence.

GO:0001181	39	A general transcription initiation factor activity that contributes to transcription start site selection and transcription initiation of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase I. Factors required for RNA polymerase I transcription initiation include upstream activation factor (UAF), core factor (CF), TATA binding protein (TBP) and RRN3. In all species characterized, RNA polymerase I transcribes a large polycistronic transcript that is processed into several mature rRNAs (3 or 4 depending on the species), including the large subunit rRNA (28S in humans), the small subunit rRNA (18S in humans), as well as one or two additional smaller rRNAs (the 5.8S rRNA in humans). In most species, this large rRNA transcript is the sole product of RNA polymerase I. However there are rare exceptions, such as Trypanosoma brucei, where RNA polymerase I also transcribes certain mRNAs.
GO:0016251	40	A general transcription initiation factor activity that contributes to transcription start site selection and transcription initiation of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II. The general transcription factors for RNA polymerase II include TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH and TATA-binding protein (TBP). In most species, RNA polymerase II transcribes all messenger RNAs (mRNAs), most untranslated regulatory RNAs, the majority of the snoRNAs, four of the five snRNAs (U1, U2, U4, and U5), and other small noncoding RNAs. For some small RNAs there is variability between species as to whether it is transcribed by RNA polymerase II or RNA polymerase III. However there are also rare exceptions, such as Trypanosoma brucei, where RNA polymerase I transcribes certain mRNAs in addition to its normal role in rRNA transcription.
GO:0000995	41	A general transcription initiation factor activity that contributes to transcription start site selection and transcription initiation of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III. Factors required for RNA polymerase III transcription initiation include TFIIIA, TFIIIB and TFIIIC. RNA polymerase III transcribes genes encoding short RNAs, including tRNAs, 5S rRNA, U6 snRNA, the short ncRNA component of RNases P, the mitochondrial RNA processing (MRP) RNA, the signal recognition particle SRP RNA, and in higher eukaryotes a number of micro and other small RNAs, though there is some variability across species as to whether a given small noncoding RNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase II or RNA polymerase III.

GO:0140232	11225	Enables the transmembrane transfer of a cation by a channel that opens when intracellular cAMP has been bound by the channel complex or one of its constituent parts, to regulate the presynaptic membrane potential.
GO:0086060	11226	Enables the transmembrane transfer of a sodium ion by a voltage-gated channel through the plasma membrane of an AV node cardiac muscle cell contributing to the depolarization phase of an action potential. A voltage-gated channel is a channel whose open state is dependent on the voltage across the membrane in which it is embedded.
GO:0086063	11227	Enables the transmembrane transfer of a sodium ion by a voltage-gated channel through the plasma membrane of an SA node cardiac muscle cell contributing to the depolarization phase of an action potential. A voltage-gated channel is a channel whose open state is dependent on the voltage across the membrane in which it is embedded.
GO:0086061	11228	Enables the transmembrane transfer of a sodium ion by a voltage-gated channel through the plasma membrane of a bundle of His cardiac muscle cell contributing to the depolarization phase of an action potential. A voltage-gated channel is a channel whose open state is dependent on the voltage across the membrane in which it is embedded.
GO:0086062	11229	Enables the transmembrane transfer of a sodium ion by a voltage-gated channel through the plasma membrane of a Purkinje myocyte contributing to the depolarization phase of an action potential. A voltage-gated channel is a channel whose open state is dependent on the voltage across the membrane in which it is embedded.
GO:0098695	11230	Any inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor activity that is involved in regulation of postsynaptic cytosolic calcium ion concentration.

GO:0015090	11234	Enables the transfer of a solute or solutes from one side of a membrane to the other according to the reaction: Fe2+(out) = Fe2+(in). In low-affinity transport the transporter is able to bind the solute only if it is present at very high concentrations.
GO:0015092	11235	Enables the transfer of ferric iron (Fe(III) or Fe3+) ions from one side of a membrane to the other. In high-affinity transport the transporter is able to bind the solute even if it is only present at very low concentrations.
GO:0061840	11236	Enables the transfer of ferrous iron (Fe(II) or Fe2+) ions from one side of a membrane to the other. In high-affinity transport the transporter is able to bind the solute even if it is only present at very low concentrations.
GO:0051982	11237	Enables the transfer of the copper chelate copper-nicotianamine (Cu-NA) from one side of a membrane to the other.
