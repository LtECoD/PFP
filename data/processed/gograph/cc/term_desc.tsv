GO:0005786	2764	A ribonucleoprotein particle of 325 kDa composed of a 7S (300 nucleotide) RNA molecule and a complex of six different polypeptides. This binds both to the N-terminal signal peptide for proteins destined for the endoplasmic reticulum as they emerge from the large ribosomal subunit and also to the ribosome.

Pseudouridylation targets include both large and small ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), and small nuclear RNA (U2 snRNA). In addition to these catalytic H/ACA RNPs, a less abundant but more diverse class of structural H/ACA RNPs exists, which does not have pseudouridylation activity.

Only the M and S subunits are required for this reaction. If the complex binds to an unmethylated recognition site, then the complex translocates the DNA bidirectionally in an ATP-dependent manner. When the translocation is stalled by impact with another complex or unusual DNA structure, the enzyme functions as an endonuclease and cleavage of the DNA will occur, hundreds or thousands of base pairs away from the recognition site.
